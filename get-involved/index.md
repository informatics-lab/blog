If you want to work with us, there are several ways you can go about it:

1. Feel free to just start contributing to our code on [GitHub]({{site.github-url}}).
1. Come and visit us at the Met Office! We are always looking for other interesting people or organisations to work with.
1. If you already work for the Met Office, talk to us about becoming a *Lab Associate*.

###Getting set-up
If you are working closely with the Lab, you'll need some information to get set up.
