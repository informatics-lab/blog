I've created this article to allow other members of the lab to see the [contribution process](https://github.com/met-office-lab/Lab-Info/wiki/Jekyll-Contributing) in action.

Hopefully someone will fix my __sp*e*lling m*i*stakes__ and __issues of *atrocious grammar*__!

They might even suggest that I change the whole article to something which is actually useful!
