<p>The Met Office Informatics Lab combines scientists, software engineers, and designers to work closely together to come up with new ideas. We try to rapidly prototype non-business-as-usual ideas that allow people from without the Met Office get access to our information, expertise, and facilities.</p>

<p>The core group works as part of the UK's <a href="www.metoffice.gov.uk">Met Office</a>, which is one of the world's <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/who/accuracy">leading operational weather forecasters</a> and <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate-guide/science/science-behind-climate-change/hadley">climate change research institutes</a>. However, we are really keen to work with anyone who has an interest and wants to collaborate on any of our projects.</p>
