We've been hacking the user interface for our 3D weather project today with some of the Lab associates. One of the things we came up with today was [this site](http://t.co/ayzUTfnG2p) which lets you navigate through the clouds.

So far, we've got it working on an iPad Air 2 running Safari, and a Sony Xperia Z3 running Chrome. We know that some older iPads and most phones have some trouble loading all the data.

Just touch a finger on the screen to move forwards, let go to stop. (Its not a pinch zoom by the way). You might need to fly for a bit to get close to the clouds, but once in, you can swoop around to your heart's content by moving the iPad around. Have fun!
