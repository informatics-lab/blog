## Is the sky the same for everybody?
Everybody interprets weather in a different way. A **sunny day** can be different from one person to another. Look at the pictures below.

<cite>We agree, this one is a partly cloudy day …   … and that one a sunny day. No doubt.</cite> -->

<cite>We agree, this one is a partly cloudy day …</cite>

![sunny day](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/informatics-webimages/Antoine%27s+image/1.jpg)
<cite>… and that one a sunny day. No doubt.</cite>

<cite>But here, people can hesitate … and disagree with the forecaster.</cite>

![snowy day](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/informatics-webimages/Antoine%27s+image/snowy_sun.jpg)
<cite>It is sunny here. However the snow is the main fact to choose what you are going to do for the day.</cite>

That’s why **we are developing a new mobile phone application** to explore this challenge.
The user is going to be able to **teach to the app** what is a cloudy sky for them, a sunny sky or even a snowy sky: it is going to be ***YOUR* Sky**. Each day, you will choose what you think is the most relevant icon to describe the actual weather.

## What is next?
We would like to ask these same questions for the **temperature**. Is a cold day less than 4, 8 or 12 Celsius degrees Celsius? It depends on the person. That's why the Lab is going to let potential users test the app. This survey, which could be done with the [University of Exeter](http://www.exeter.ac.uk/)'s students, will improve MySky's services.
We are planning for the app to be able to provide you an **appropriate and personal forecast**.

Soon on the AppStore!
