It’s going to be tricky to condense my many years of learning about glitter, doodling and bright colours, but I’ll try my best. Obviously there are some bits I’ll have to miss out as they’re the bits where I sprinkle my magic dust!

## Warm up

I’d like to kick off with a quick warm up. So stop reading this and stand up, and let’s do some stretches. Just kidding!

I often use this technique to help me focus and get in the zone. It’s really good practice to force yourself to design to a small size, so that you make choices about the messages you are trying to deliver. If you follow me on twitter ([@rossymids][ross-twitter]) or like my [doodling page on Facebook][ross-facebook], you’ll see I produce quite a lot of these tiles.

The idea is to spend 5 minutes thinking of a song lyric and then visualising it. Go!

## Setting the scene

Condensing the topic of design into a Lab School session was fairly daunting. I could talk in-depth about colour, alignment, typography and design through the years, but it would turn into a University course.

We are all content producers across many social platforms and are increasingly being exposed to more and more design trying to attract our attention. Good design resonates – either subconsciously or by impact. Products and services are now being designed to look and feel better for the user and there is now a certain expectation of good design.


> ‘Everyone is a designer’

is a term most designers will be familiar with and it’s kind of true! There aren’t many professions where customers and clients have such strong opinions on what is being recommended by a service provider. It’s because we all know what we like and what we find visually appealing. Hopefully this session will help to reveal why we prefer some design over others. Essentially, I’ve boiled it down to my four main principles of design and then how I apply those techniques throughout my typical design process.

![Four design principals](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/informatics-webimages/articles/2015-07-30-lab-school-design/design-principles.png)


## Four main design principles

The four key elements I consider are essential when designing are:

1. **Consistency** -  Keeping the look and feel of a design / brand if it gets used on an exhibition panel, social media tile, leaflet or web page. This repetition brings familiarity. 
2. **Clarity ** - Ensuring that the design is simple and concise, maintaining legibility by using good contrast and limiting the amount of fonts and colours used. 
3. **Hierarchy** - Making sure that there is a clear focal point and structure to help make the information appealing and digestible. Title text, grouping relevant items and a clear call to action are good ways to achieve this. 
4. **Fit for purpose ** - Designing for the right audience – style / language as well as platform and channel. Helping the design to achieve what it was intended for.

As you can see, I’ve also added communication into the graphic above. Considering these elements will help to achieve good communication material – but there’s also the importance of communicating throughout the design process to achieve a great end result.

## My design process

Here’s what I consider to be the crucial stages of a project to transform it from a bundle of ideas to reality. Of course, this can be upscaled or downsized depending on the size of the design task.

### One - Understand

Communication is essential at the start of a project to work out what’s required. Discuss, listen and challenge. Find out what the purpose of the piece is. It’s a bit like being a detective piecing together information from a number of sources.  Remember to set milestones and delivery dates for completion!  At this stage in particular, positivity is key. Being approachable and helping to nurture someone’s idea is what it’s all about.

### Two - Explore

Research the project and get insight and inspiration. Start looking at other similar designs and topics and draw in inspiration from a wide range of sources. I get really random inspiration from everyday stuff around me. At the minute I particularly enjoy the simplicity and beauty of metal road signs! …strange I know! You might find more traditional inspiration at https://www.pinterest.com , http://designspiration.net or even google images.

### Three - Visualise

Start sketching and bringing your ideas to life. Allow yourself to put everything down on paper – release and explore your thoughts even if you aren’t sure where they’re going. If you’ve got lots of information, you’ll likely start to begin structuring and ordering that at this stage. Pull together the story and begin thinking about your key messages and design features.

### Four - Collaborate

Work closely with your client and discuss ideas and thoughts. Being able to show a mood board and sketches at this stage helps them understand the direction you are going. Discuss and test with colleagues and collaborate with skill sets – to get the best results face the fact you may well not be able to do this on your own!  …and remember to be flexible and adapt! Whilst inviting opinions your ideas may change direction – be flexible and / or be bold in the decisions you’ve made and explain why.

### Five - Develop

Start working up your ideas so they are nearer to how you consider the final output. I often work to extremes (a safer route through to something a bit more maverick!) to provide a series of options. Again the testing and feedback loop is crucial at this stage. Gaining insight from the client, colleagues and the intended audience all helps to steer the project in the right direction in the drive for completion.

### Exercise:

### Six - Deliver

If you’ve followed the previous stages, it should ensure that there are no surprises for the client. They’ll be fully on board with your idea and will be pleased with the outcome.  It’s important to remember to evaluate and record what did / didn’t work i.e. how many times was the graphic shared, did people understand the message…  Also share any successes and best practice with the client / colleagues and anyone that will listen!

### Exercise:

![Exercise 5](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/informatics-webimages/articles/2015-07-30-lab-school-design/exercise-5.png)

The key thing is being able to move through the stages quickly and seamlessly and be able to adapt to different projects. I can’t emphasise enough the importance of communicating throughout the project (milestones, progress updates) to ensure a successful piece of communication.
