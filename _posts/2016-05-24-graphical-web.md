### An invitation to share your knowledge at the Graphical Web 2016

Graphical Web is an annual, global conference that showcases open source technologies for presenting visual information on the web and the wonderful things created with them. The conference runs from 1st to 4th November 2016.

The Met Office Informatics Team are a recently formed inter-disciplinary group who create prototypes to expand and improve the use of environmental data. They will be hosting this year's Graphical Web Conference at the Met Office's corporate headquarters and conference facility in Exeter, UK.  

We are inviting proposals for contributions in the following formats -

* 20 and 40 minute talks

* Small group breakout discussions

* Hands on skill share

* Roundtable discussion

Topics of particular interest include -

* 3D/WebGL

* Apps (web and mobile)

* Art and Design

* Browser and Viewer Implementations, Comparisons, Benchmarks

* Data/Scientific Visualization

* Gaming and animation

* GIS, Mapping and Location-based services

* Publishing and Printing with Web based Tools

* Standards Improvement (e.g. SVG, CSS, HTML5, Canvas, WebGL, declarative 3D)

Please contact us and share your ideas; we really do want to make this the best event we can.

Closing date is 1st July 2016.

Follow the Talk link at [2016.GraphicalWeb.org](http://2016.graphicalweb.org/)

### Who else will be there?

We've already received some great proposals from regulars and some new faces. From Philip Brohan - Met Office Hadley Centre and [OldWeather.org](http://www.oldweather.org) we'll be learning about visualizing changes and uncertainties in historical weather data, and from Ed Hawkins we'll discover more about his work leading to the [Spiraling Global Temperatures](http://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/2016/spiralling-global-temperatures/) plot that recently went viral on social media.

### Some recordings from Graphical Web 2014

If you've not attended before, these talks from 2014 will give a of the flavour of the conference.

### Making the most of your trip

It's worth noting that Exeter is served by its own small international airport with regular services to hubs at Paris, Amsterdam and Dublin.  We're also quite close to Bristol International Airport. So check these out when looking for the best deals on flights.

Though we're confident that the Graphical Web will be well worth coming to the UK for, we'd also like to see you at Mozilla Festival in London.  The Informatics Lab team will be at Mozilla Festival running workshops and enjoying the creative energy of one of the best tech events in Europe.

### Already submitted a proposal?

We've already received some great proposals. So if you've already submitted an abstract then don't worry, we won't keep you waiting. In fact there's now time to submit another - yes, we'd actually rather you gave two or three 20 minute talks than one of an hour.
