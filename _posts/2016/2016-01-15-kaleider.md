As you may know, we're always on the lookout for interesting people to talk to, be inspired by, and collaborate with. For a while now, we've been looking for a place we can occasionally work in the city of Exeter. We think getting out and about can help us meet people with good ideas in our city.

 Today marks the first day we have been to work at [Kaleider](http://kaleider.com/), an organisation/space/movement in Exeter which aims to get people together to do cool stuff...you can read more about how they explain it [here](http://kaleider.com/about/).

It was also great to be able to chat to local MP Ben Bradshaw about all the exciting collaboration that is going on in Exeter. Kaleider knows all the interesting people!

 Thanks Kaleider - we're looking forward to doing some good stuff here!
