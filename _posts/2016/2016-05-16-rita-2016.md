We are proud to announce that we have been **Highly Commended** for Innovation in Technology at the [Real IT Awards 2016](http://www.real-it-awards.co.uk/). We were shortlisted by the jury for our [4D Weather Visualisation project](http://www.informaticslab.co.uk/projects/three-d-vis.html).

We're excited to try and 'WOW' the judges again at RITA 2017! **Work in progress!**
