We recently welcomed three Graphic Design students from Ravensbourne to join the team for the week, as part of our ongoing MozFest partnership with Mozilla.

The placements were awarded as a result of a brief challenging the students to analyse and communicate weather-based datasets in infographic form. We then helped to feedback to the students giving tips and advice on their submissions...of course this feedback was in the form of a handy infographic!

With the help of both Mozilla and Ravensbourne the selected students were invited to work with our team, preparing graphics for a MozFest Fringe Event and working as part of our MozFest team to prepare activities for the event.

We tasked them to work on a live brief, developing promotional material for the international [Graphical Web](http://2016.graphicalweb.org/) conference, a MozFest Fringe Event, being organised by the Informatics Lab and held at the Met Office in November. This is a high profile, global 4-day conference, attended by over 30 speakers including Google, Mozilla and Amazon.

They were briefed by the Head of the Lab, Design Lead and Senior Designer and worked quickly to understand the context and brainstorm ideas of assets to develop. They portioned the work between themselves according to their particular areas of interest – Nathaniel looked at packaging and way finding, Cherin working on animation and social graphics and Natasha developing a booklet, posters and lanyard designs.

They got stuck in to the challenge – we discussed and set tasks at the start of each day, and they worked to manage their own time to ensure milestones were hit. We reviewed the progress at the end of each day and set them the challenge to present back at the end of the week, in front of the wider team…and they presented clearly and confidently on their ideas and designs. The Head of the Lab commented that he felt that all of the work could be used, and was very impressed with the amount produced in a week. They each pushed the boundaries of the brief as well. Nathaniel showcased his projection ideas across the walls of Kaleider, the collaborative workspace we attend each week; Cherin explored, researched and prepared a SnapChat geo-filter for the conference; Natasha created a bespoke lanyard design incorporating the schedule as part of the pouch to save printing costs.

As a result of their great work, we have offered them free passes to attend the conference to see their work on show first hand.

We also threw in the odd challenge along the way. They all produced and presented back on a logo brief to create an identity for a new computer system being worked on by the wider team. They were briefed by scientists and coders within the team and were given an hour to see what they could come up with – it resulted in a bundle of designs from each of them, any of which could be implemented.

We also gave them short notice to prepare for a mock interview. Each presented their portfolio for critique and answered a number of questions, similar to how we would conduct an interview to join the team. They each came across as enthusiastic, knowledgable and keen to learn.

It was a pleasure having them as part of the team for the week – we really appreciated their hard work and they represented Ravensbourne and in turn Mozilla very well. We wish them all the best for the future and are looking forward to seeing them at MozFest and [Graphical Web!](http://2016.graphicalweb.org/)
