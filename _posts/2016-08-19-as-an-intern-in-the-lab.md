# The Lab, the team, projects
The Lab is an innovative R&D team part of the [Met Office](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/). It combines scientists, technologists and designers to make environmental science and data useful. Thanks to this joined-up structure, the mix of skills and the sharing of knowledge provide disruptive solutions.

But let's speak about my personal experience. If you are expecting to have your own office as I was, it's not going to happen... and that's a good thing!! In the Lab, everybody is working in the same room. There is only one big table as in this kind of office called [hackspace](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=hackerspace&espv=2&biw=1280&bih=614&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwik5JTizs3OAhWHLhoKHQdaBZ0Q_AUIBigB&dpr=2). It will foster more dialogue and ideas sharing.

You have to be ready for this way of working. To be **open-minded** is essential! *Can you cook?* Your answer cannot be negative! Of course you can, you just have to learn how to, find good recipes, ingredients and a kitchen but obviously, YOU, as a human being can!

It's exactly the same in the Lab. For instance, designers are learning how to code. And it was the case for me when I arrived. I literally jumped into JavaScript, GitHub and stackoverflow. And I learned from there. JavaScript has been an amazing ingredient for the recipes I was working on.

# Why you should join the Lab?
As an intern, I discoverd an open-source and collaborative way of working. Using [GitHub](https://github.com/met-office-lab) for IT project is a great way to handle versioning problem and to share knowledge.

In the Informatics Lab, you find all the advantage of a startup:

* `Learn` a lot and `quickly`. You could work on several [projects](http://www.informaticslab.co.uk/#projects) at the same time, even if they are completely different. It's the best way to be efficient. If you are bored on one project, have a rush on the other. You should get to a point where both projects will help each other. Developing new skills is always rewarding. Moreover, the [team](http://www.informaticslab.co.uk/team/) is really skilled. PhD, experience: they are using *100%* of their brain... and working with smart people is really stimulating and challenging. They are also always ready to help you. Don't hesitate to ask questions and be ready to give all your best!

* `Flexibility` is something you are going to find in the Lab as well. The hierarchy is less strict and less visible as in other kind of organisations. When you are working on a project, you are the master: do whatever you want to crack the problem. Personally, I found it really exciting.

* `Casual` atmosphere. We take the time to know each other and to understand what are the motivations of each person. It's also important for the work, to be more efficient and to keep people motivated.

Also, because you are part of a bigger organisation, the Met Office, you enjoy other amazing advantages:

* `Stability` & `Security`. You have a set working day, whereas in a startup that's not the case.

* `Benefits` of the Met Office. You will enjoy the building and everything else that's provided... like holiday!

In a nutshell, in the Lab, you have all the good points of both Startups and Big companies without the drawbacks! What are you waiting for!
