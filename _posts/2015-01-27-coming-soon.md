Hello.

This is the Met Office Lab blog. This will be used to write about our adventures in the
lab and announce any things we think are worth sharing!

In time we will create a theme all of our own for the blog but for now we're going to
start by using [pixyll][1].

> Pixyll is a simple, beautiful theme for Jekyll that emphasizes content rather than aesthetic fluff. It's mobile _first_, fluidly responsive, and delightfully lightweight.

So just hang tight and we'll get some excellent content up soon!
