    The Informatics Lab creates prototypes quickly by mixing disciplines, sharing
    knowledge and enabling access to <span class="nobr">Met Office</span> data. This allows us to learn lessons for the
    organisation.

  <p class="timeline-after">
    From one-day hacks to week-long intense sprints and longer larger projects,
    we have completed a lot of projects in our first year. Here are our favourite five&hellip;

    4D Weather Visualisation
  </h2>

  <p class="timeline-after">
    We created new exciting <a href="http://www.informaticslab.co.uk/projects/three-d-vis.html">weather visualisations</a> by developing <a href="http://www.informaticslab.co.uk/technical/2015/10/05/data-encoding.html">cutting-edge browser technology</a>.
    This project is currently on the short-list for the 'Innovation in Technology' <a href="http://www.real-it-awards.co.uk/awards-2016.html#shortlist">Real IT Award</a>.
    <br /><br />
    We also ran idea generation sessions at MozSpace, tested with the public at the
    RAMM Exeter, led discussions at MozFest 2015 and <a href="http://www.informaticslab.co.uk/report/2016/04/11/compression-paper.html">wrote an in-depth report about it</a>.

  <p class="timeline-after">
    We were invited to contribute to a book on <a href="https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/informatics-webimages/articles/2016-03-30-year-one/C006_9780128031926.pdf">Cloud Computing</a> based on our exploration of
    software in the cloud, Docker and containers. We have also been praised in a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/507081/2904936_Bean_Review_Web_Accessible.pdf">government review</a> on big data analysis.

  <p class="no-box timeline-after">
    We worked with our Platforms Team to introduce Docker, which could
    help to increase the efficiency of our servers from 25% to 90%.

  <p class="timeline-after">
    We have been exploring gaming technologies, creating mobile
    controllers and developing visualisations for virtual reality. We
    collaborated with Young Rewired State to run a hackathon as part of London
    Design Week.
