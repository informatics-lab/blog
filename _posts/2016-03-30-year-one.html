    We continue to produce prototypes quickly by mixing disciplines, sharing
    knowledge and enabling access to <span class="nobr">Met Office</span> data.
  </p>

  <h5>
    Did you know?
  </h5>

  <p class="timeline-after">
    We test and try new technologies, exploring ways to make our Met Office
    operational services more robust. This allows us to learn lessons for the
    organisation and help to develop best practice guidelines.
  </p>

  <p class="timeline-after">
    From one day hacks, week long intense sprints and longer larger projects,
    we’ve covered a lot in our first year. Here’s five of our most useful
    projects&hellip;

  <h2>
    Project One
  </h2>

  <p class="nomargin">
    In our first larger project we worked to render our forecast data to create
    new browser visualisations by exploiting advances in technology.<br /><br />
    We ran idea generation sessions at MozSpace, tested with the public at the
    RAAM Exeter and led discussions at MozFest 2015, showcasing our demos.

  </h5>

  <p class="timeline-after">
    Our work in compressing big data in the browser, by encoding data as video,
    is helping to inform better products for our Aviation customers.

  <h3 class="timeline-before timeline-after">
    Number Two
  </h3>

  <p class="timeline-after">
    We submitted a paper on ‘Cloud Computing’ based on our exploration of
    software in the cloud, Docker and containers. We have also been peer
    reviewed in a paper about Interdisciplinary Teams by Aiko Yamashita from
    Oslo and Akershus University College of Applied Sciences.
  </p>

  <h5>￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼
    Did you know?
  </h5>

  <p class="timeline-after">
    We’ve been working with our Platforms Team and by introducing Docker we may
    help to allow an increase in the efficiency of our servers from 25% to 90%.

  </p>

  <h2>
    Virtual Reality
  </h2>

  <p class="timeline-after">
    We’ve been exploring and developing gaming technologies, creating mobile
    controllers and developing visualisations for virtual reality. We
    collaborated with Young Rewired State to run a hackathon as part of London
    Design Week.
  </p>

  <h5>
    ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Did you know?
  </h5>

  <p class="timeline-after">
    This work is helping gaming communities to exploit and easily integrate our
    datasets. We’ve also been exploring syncing data and visualisations via wifi
    across platforms – potentially helping forecasters explain and share the
    weather story across various bandwidths.

  </p>

  <h2>
    Side projects
  </h2>

  <p class="timeline-after">
    By also working on these side-projects we’ve developed new connections and
    continue to support the Met Office as being seen as innovative and creative,
    helping with Technology recruitment campaigns.

  </p>

  <h2>
    Project Two
  </h2>

  <p class="timeline-after">
    Our second larger project is exploring how people can interact with our data
    by developing and testing bots and Natural Language Processing systems for
    decision-making.
  </p>

  <h5>
    Did you know?
  </h5>

  <p class="timeline-after">
    By working outside of the network we reduce the risk to the organisation and
    help to feedback learnings to make operational services more robust. We can
    also try things quickly and cheaply at a low risk.
  </p>
</div>

<h2 class="timeline-before what-next">
  What’s next?
</h2>

<p class="what-next">
  We will continue to build networks and help to allow organisations to easily
  exploit our data.<br /><br />We are helping to organise Graphical Web Conference in
  November which the <span class="nobr">Met Office</span> is hosting. More details to be announced soon!
