summary: We have built up our own culture in the lab. These principals encapsulate that culture.

Over the last couple of years we have been developed our own culture in the Lab. Recently we have been talking about a set of principals that would help newcomers get up to speed quickly. They are not exhaustive and we can't take credit for inventing all of them. However, we feel they encapsulate how to strive to work as a team.

## 1. Ask forgiveness not permission

If it's not obvious how to go about doing something in an 'official' or 'correct' manner, just go ahead and do it anyway. If it was the wrong thing to do, people will understand if your intentions were good, and you (and perhaps they) will have learnt something in the process. This attitude precipitates action and progress.

## 2. To live a creative life, we must lose our fear of being wrong

When you are creating something new, mistakes are more than inevitable, they are integral. We do not learn without making mistakes, successes only come after a series of failures. The Lab fosters a culture where it is safe to be wrong. We need to listen to opposing viewpoints with an open mind, offer our ideas and opinions readily, and encourage others to do the same. Repeatedly making the same mistake is, however, to be avoided when at all possible.

## 3. If there is no project card it shouldn't happen

For each project, we create a high level project card describing it (currently using Trello). If you find yourself working on a project without an associated card, then you need to stop and think: am I [shaving a yack](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving)? This approach gives us clarity of purpose, empowering people to act in a way they can be confident is useful. It also coordinates the group to acts as a whole. The project cards cover: 

* why we are doing this project?
* a brief imagined future press release (a la [Amazon](http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2006/11/working_backwards.html))
* concrete goals or questions to answer
* who the stakeholders are
* and what research themes the project belongs to.

Crucially, these cards are private in order to encourage brutally honest (and therefore accurate) project definitions. I also helps us decide on what we are doing as a team, leading to ownership of and therefore pride in what we are doing.

## 4. If there is no blog post it didn't happen

Our work can produce a variety of useful outcomes: for instance a working prototype, a peer-reviewed research paper, or sometimes just an informed opinion. We record the useful things we do primarily as blog posts on our website. This has a few benefits. It is a historical record of our achievements which we can point to. It obviously also allows us to share our thoughts with the world. Finally, it is a useful exercise to verbalise what was successful (or not) about a project. I helps us distil our thoughts and gain perspective.

## 5. No bean bags

"Innovation" has, in some places, become a dirty word. It conjurers up images of ping-pong-tables and beanbag-filled spaces that people use merely to talk endlessly about what they are going to do. This is bad innovation culture. Incidentally, we like bean-bags and ping-pong as much as the next person, but good intentions alone are not enough for productive innovation. Which brings us to...

## 6. Make things

Simply talking about things isn't enough. Ideas are cheap. Good innovation is built upon foundations of hard graft. As soon as possible you should make a proof of concept, prototype, minimum viable product - whatever you want to call it. Seeing is believing.

## 7. Premature optimisation is the root of all evil

This old computer adage applies to more than just code. You can spend hours talking about how to do something, but there is only so much useful theorising you can do without the insight gained from getting your hands dirty. When building something the first thing you should do is make it work, even if it doesn't satisfy all of the requirements. You should create something simple and then iterate on it to make it better, but always leaving it in a working and usable state.

## 8. No free rides

The Lab is a hard-working close-knit team - you can't get a free ride, and there is nowhere to hide. We'll do all we can to help you perform, but if aren't self-motivated to work with us, then perhaps this isn't the place for your.

## 9. Spirit of the law not letter of the law

Principles/manifestos etc are all very well, but the bottom line is that these are useful tools to think about how we work, not legal lines in the sand. Blindly following documents like this can lead to unhelpful constraints. The real world is complex and shades of grey, so we need to apply these principles judiciously.
