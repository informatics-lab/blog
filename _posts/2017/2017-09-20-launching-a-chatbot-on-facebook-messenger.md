## What does it do?

We've been working on a chatbot which the general public can use to ask questions about the 7 day weather forecast via a chat platform such as Facebook Messenger.

We want it to be able to answer general questions such as **"what will the weather be in Exeter tomorrow?"** but also continue to have a flowing dialog of follow up questions which maintain context. For example the user should be able to ask **"what about this weekend?"** and the bot should remember that we are still talking about Exeter. Or questions like **"Will it rain tomorrow?"**, **"Should I take an umbrella with me today?"** or **"Should I go for a bike ride this weekend?"**.

We also want the bot to be conversational, people love to ask bots all sorts of random questions ranging from **"Are you a human?"** to **"When is your birthday?"**. The bot should be able to respond to these in a fun and informal way.
