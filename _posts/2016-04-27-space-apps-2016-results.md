As we announced in a [previous post](http://www.informaticslab.co.uk/events/2016/03/12/space-apps-2016-is-coming.html), the Met Office hosted the [2016 NASA Space Apps Challenge](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/). This year, more than **1,200 projects** have been created around the world.

## Results
[Rachel Prudden](http://www.informaticslab.co.uk/profiles/rachel-prudden.html), member of the Lab, has been the **team leader** of one of the projects from the Met Office Hackathon: [Clouds and Contrails](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/aero/clouds-or-contrails/projects/contrailers-exeter) which tackles how to tell the difference between the two.
This project has been shortlisted and is part of the **2016 global finalist nominees**, along with four other international projects, for the [Galactic Impact award](https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/awards/global-finalists).

Using the FlightAware API, they manage to assess the probability that a person is seeing a contrail instead of a cloud. For more information, watch the video below.

You can also use the code. All is open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/spaceapps-exeter-cloud-or-contrails).

By the end of May, we will know if Rachel’s team won the main prize: places to see a NASA launch!
Stay tuned!
