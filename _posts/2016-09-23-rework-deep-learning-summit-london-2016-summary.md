We attended the excellent [Re-work: Deep Learning Summit][rework-2016] in London this week. This post is a summary of our favourite talks from the conference.

### Continual Deep Learning

Neural networks can only learn to do one thing at a time. Image recognition, song recognition, video game playing. This is a major failing of machine learning. Continual deep learning is using a progressing neural network to learn multiple skills.

### The Case For (and Against) Building Chat Bots with Deep Learning

Flow-chart vs data driven. Flow-chart is an edge case of an edge case, you have to craft the precise flow but you can make it very useful if the user does exactly what you expect. Data driven takes a large amount of data and finds the statistically most likely response to a collection of words based on past experience. This appears more human and intelligent but is not useful for getting things done.

### Humana ex Machina: Delivering positive human experiences in chatbots

People get frustrated when talking to an automated process in customer services. People respond much better if they feel there is a human involved. Therefore bots must appear to empathise with the user.

### Modeling Personality in a Chatbot

Luka is a chatbot which learns your personality as you speak to it and speaks back in a similar way.

### Making chatbots functional, fun and fit for purpose

Tina the T-Rex. A Facebook Messenger bot for children to ask about the life of a T-Rex. Built during a hack week as a Q&A bot using api.ai. Picked up by NatGeo Kids for their website.
