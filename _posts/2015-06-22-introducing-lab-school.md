We are pleased to announce a new Informatics Lab initiative called Lab School. Lab School is a monthly training session which will be held in the lab from **10am-12pm on the last Thursday of each month**.

One of the most exciting things about working in the Lab is getting to learn and use new technologies. These sessions will allow us to share what we've learned with each other.

Running a session is open to all Lab members (core and associates) and must be designed according to the following guidelines:

  * A Lab School session should last no longer than **two hours**.
  * Attendees should be able to **drop in and out**.
  * The session will begin with a **10-15 minute talk**.
  * There will also be a **two minute short version** of the talk which can be quickly repeated to latecomers.
  * The session will comprise of a **series of exercises** which will be made **available as a web page** on the Lab website.
  * Attendees will complete the sessions using their own laptops (although we may have a couple of spares).
  * The exercises should require **minimal additional software**, if more advanced tools are required then AWS instances (or similar) should be provided for the duration of the session.
    * To be inclusive of people following the exercises in the future a **detailed description** (**or** even better a **machine image**) of the provided instance should be included on the web page to allow it to be recreated.

Sessions will be advertised on the [public calendar][website-calendar], MetNet, by email to the associate mailing list and will be open to all (not just associates).

This format allows the most flexibility for attendees. You can participate in as much or as little of the session as you like, fit it around meetings and other duties (even if they are in the middle of a session), or even just follow the exercises at home afterwards. You will be able to follow along at your own speed to get the most out of the session.
