The Met Office Informatics Lab is here: Welcome!

The Lab makes environmental data and science useful to human beings.

The Lab creates prototypes (fast). The Lab learns and innovates but the point is not innovation, the point is usefulness (I like useful things, particularly when they are beautiful). The aim of the Lab is to make things better, at the Met Office â€¦ and beyond.

The Lab is made of scientists, code developers, technologists, designers, forecasters (and others). We have a core team of nine. We also have associates to the Lab: some work at the Met Office, some are in the outside world.

The Lab is a space for collaboration. You are welcome to [get involved](/#get-involved).


This is what we are trying to do first: to place you [inside a forecast model](/projects/three-d-vis.html) so you can really see what the model does. Watch this space, more coming soon!
