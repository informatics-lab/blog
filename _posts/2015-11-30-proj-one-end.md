Oh well, we have now finished our [4D visualisation project](http://www.informaticslab.co.uk/projects/three-d-vis.html). We presented all our prototypes on the 18th of November at the [50th anniversary](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/modelling-systems/unified-model/weather-forecasting/nwpfifty) of the first computer generated weather forecast produced by the Met Office. Good fun.

You can watch the variety of prototypes we have created in [this video] (plus you can also access all codes and play with the prototypes by following the links at the end of the video or on the [project page]()).

And it’s not all about the prototypes, we have learnt a few things too while doing this:

* Deployment in the cloud: [Docker](http://www.informaticslab.co.uk/lab-school/2015/06/24/lab-school-docker.html), [Kubernetes](http://www.informaticslab.co.uk/infrastructure/2015/10/01/building-with-kubernetes.html)
* [Video compression](http://www.informaticslab.co.uk/technical/2015/10/05/data-encoding.html) and transmission of scientific data to enable science in the browser
* [WebGL](http://www.webgl.com/), [d3.js](http://d3js.org/), [three.js](http://threejs.org/) ([Lab now a contributor!](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/pull/7527))
* [UX Design](http://www.informaticslab.co.uk/lab-school/2015/07/30/lab-school-design.html)

You can find a longer write-up looking back at Project One [here]().

Give it a go and play with the different prototypes, we would like to hear what you think.
