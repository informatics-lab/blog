The Met Office Informatics Lab combines scientists, software engineers, and designers to work closely together to come up with new ideas. We try to rapidly prototype non-business-as-usual ideas that allow people from without the Met Office get access to our information, expertise, and facilities.

The core group works as part of the UK's [Met Office](www.metoffice.gov.uk), which is one of the world's [leading operational weather forecasters](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/about-us/who/accuracy) and [climate change research institutes](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate-guide/science/science-behind-climate-change/hadley). However, we are really keen to work with anyone who has and interest and wants to help on any of our projects.
