For instructions on writing blog posts, updating projects or updating the site see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Build the site locally
Note: You must run with node version < 7.

#### Requirements
 * May require RVM to get correct version of Ruby, this will need homebrew.
   * Homebrew: `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
   * RVM: `curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash`
   * `rvm install ruby 2.1.2`
 * Ruby bundler
   * `sudo gem install bundler`
 * npm
 * grunt
   * `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/met-office-lab/met-office-lab.github.io.git

# Enter repository
cd met-office-lab.github.io

# Install dependancies
sudo bundle install # Installs jekyll and related libraries
npm install # Installs grunt and build tools

# Serve the site
grunt serve
```

### Blog images

This repo contains a neat helper script for uploading pictures to the blog. It takes an image path as an argument and returns a url that you can use in your blog post. You can also copy an image to your clipboard and run the command with no arguments and it will upload from your clipboard.

#### Requirements
 * aws-cli (`pip install awscli`) (and configured with keys that can write to the `informatics-webimages` bucket)
 * pngpaste (`brew install pngpaste`)
 
#### Setup

Once you've got this repo cloned somewhere and you've installed the requirements you can just run the `scripts/upload_image.sh` script directly, but you'll probably want to setup an alias to it in your `~/.bashrc`

`alias blogimage=<path-to-your-local-blog-repo>/scripts/upload_image.sh`

#### Example usage

```
$ blogimage ~/Downloads/alberto-arribas.png

Copied the url to your clipboard!
```

```
