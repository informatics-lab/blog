Hello! I'm Tom.

For me the Informatics Lab presents an exciting opportunity to work closer with the Met Office's world-leading Scientists. I am really hoping gain an insight into some of the clever stuff they do and help add some magical, cutting-edge technology fairy dust to better convey what's really going on.

Prior to joining the Lab I have been primarily working in middleware with Java in the Met Office's Data Services team. I have a real appetite to learn and as such have dabbled in various front and back-end technologies too, something I'm really looking forward to expanding upon whilst working in the Lab.

Outside of work, my main passion is sports, especially rugby! I play for my local team and enjoy the social side of rugby as much as the playing side. I have some really exciting things going on this year; We are currently working on extending our house, we have just got a new labrador puppy 'Harry' (in the picture) and I am getting married in August to long-term girlfried Nikki!
