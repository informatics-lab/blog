Hello! I'm Tom.

I enjoy working in the Informatics Lab as it presents varied opportunities to work closer with colleagues not only in technology but from across the organisation, and with external partners. I enjoy gaining insights into all the clever stuff that goes on here at the Met Office, and hope to help expose and improve some of this through utilising the latest technologies, tools and techniques.

Prior to joining the Lab I was primarily working in middleware with Java in the Met Office's Data Services team. I have a real appetite to learn, and enjoy using both client-side and server-side technologies, something I'm really enjoying expanding upon whilst working in the Lab.

Outside of work, my main passion is sports, especially rugby! I play for my local team and enjoy the social side of rugby as much as the playing side. I have some really exciting things going on this year; My wife Nikki and I are expecting our first child in December, and this has placed a fairly fixed deadline on the completion of my basement conversion project at home, which I have been working on for the last year or so.
