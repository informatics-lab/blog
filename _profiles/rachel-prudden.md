I joined the Met Office in 2012 as a Visual Weather developer for the GeoApps team. Since then I've been involved in various projects related to data visualisation, mainly working in Python and JavaScript. I've always been curious about the scientific side of meteorology, and I'd like to see the Lab start to bridge the gap between Science and Technology.
