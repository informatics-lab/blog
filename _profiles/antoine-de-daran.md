I am a forth year student from "Ecole Centrale de Nantes", a french engineering school. From April 2016 to August 2016, I will be part of the Informatics Lab team.

Last summer, in 2015, I went to Brazil for a humanitarian mission in Lagoa Encantada. With others students of my school, we have improved the living conditions of this small village from the state of Bahia.

I have been sales Manager of the Junior Enterprise "[Centrale Nantes Etudes](http://en.centralenantesetudes.fr)". This students association gives contracts from companies to the students of my school.

I also like to do some sports and to travel around the world. Follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/AntoineDeDaran)!
