I'm one of the Met Office Informatics Lab's resident "scientists". Currently, "doing science" involves lots of stuff that isn't science - moving data about in batch jobs, writing thousands of lines of code, reading piles of academic papers. I think Lab can let everyone get closer to what science is really about: understanding what's going on. I've always been passionate about communicating science in a way that makes people want to listen (at least, that's the goal).

So far my career has taken me all over the place. For my [PhD](https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/uk-ac-man-scw:137178) I had to negotiate leeches and elephants whilst living deep in the Borneo rain forest for three months. This was all to find out more about how clouds are made, and how that might change if we cut the rain forest down. I've also done work (feeling rather travel sick) racing 50 feet above the ocean in the UK's [FAAM](http://www.faam.ac.uk/) research aircraft. Since then I've worked at the Met Office researching the cutting edge field of Seasonal to Decadal climate modelling, before joining the Lab in 2015.

Outside of work, I also enjoy taking things to bits, putting them back together, and building new things: computers, hi-fi speakers, various parts of my house (all the the distress of my long suffering wife). I love talking about stuff I find interesting, so I started [TEDxUniversityOfManchester](https://tedxuniversityofmanchester.wordpress.com/) and the [Barometer Podcast](http://thebarometer.podbean.com/). I especially love learning music (check out my bands [here](http://www.rosieeade.co.uk/) and [here](http://stonethecrowsband.com/)), and adding to my ever growing collection of instruments.
