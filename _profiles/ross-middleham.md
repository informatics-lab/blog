Creative design is what I do. I live and breathe design taking inspiration from everything around me.

I like to surround myself with designs, objects and things that inspire me. Having these things can help to create that spark when you need it. I particularly love all things retro – 70s oranges and 80s neons always catch my eye.

I work as Design Lead across the Met Office, collaborating with other organisations, agencies and universities on a wide range of creative projects.

I recently developed an event called 'Design Storm' as a way of helping to bring together industry creatives and undergraduates to inspire, collaborate and innovate.
