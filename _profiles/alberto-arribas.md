I am a lucky chap, I like what I do for a living.

The Lab is the major innovation department at the UK Met Office, combining scientists, technologists and designers to make environmental science and data useful across multiple sectors. The team works with the likes of NASA, Amazon, Microsoft and UK Government Departments to build prototypes and create new approaches and tools to solve problems and deliver transformation.

Previously, I have led the development of world-leading weather and climate forecasting systems, published over 60 academic papers and been an editor for leading scientific journals, whilst lecturing and being a committee member for organisations such as the World Meteorological Organisation and the USA National Academy of Science.
