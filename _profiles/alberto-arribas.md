Hola! I am a lucky chap, I like what I do for a living.

During my years in science doing what scientists do (co-authoring 40 odd papers, lecturing and being committee member for orgs like the World Meteorological Organisation and the USA National Academy of Science, being part of the editorial team of journals such as QJ, travelling a bit to attend conferences and other similar things) my job has been taking me, more and more, towards the interface between science and technology, particularly in the last thirteen years while developing forecasting systems at the Met Office.

The latest stop in this journey is the Lab. I cannot think of a better place to be to make science and data useful.
