Following an assignment as mascot for the Visual Weather development team, I have recently taken up the post of rat in residence in the Informatics Lab.
Like all rats I have a keen sense of smell so I hope to help by sniffing out good ideas and giving them the publicity they deserve. I have my own Twitter account at @LabbyTheRat where I post updates about what's happening in the Lab.
