Inspired by the project seen in the youtube link below, we have decided to build our own version of the augmented reality sandpit here in the Met Office's Informatics Lab.

The idea initially is to replicate the functionality of the existing application, then hack away to add additional weather and ground conditions to further enhance the augmented reality experience and overall fun of the learning environment.
