## Project description
Working at the Microsoft offices in Reading, a small team of us from the lab have been exploring how to expose the national climate archive data via a chatbot ui.
This bot now allows users to ask searching questions in natural language about the weather and climate in the UK.
We have been using the [JADE platform](/projects/jade.html) as the back end to support real-time distributed big-data queries against the archive.

Here we illustrate how the data required to answer a simple question can be distributed across a cluster in realtime and distilled into the information the user needs.
