## Project Description
Our Weather Impacts team has developed a prototype forecasting tool called Global Hazard Map, which uses open source [Geoserver](http://geoserver.org/), with [ESRI](http://www.esri.com/) [ArcGIS](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgisonline) and [Python](https://www.python.org/), to allow users to collate and inspect hazard forecasts and monitoring datasets from a variety of sources within one user-friendly, web interface. The Lab and the Weather Impacts Team have collaborated to let users access this information from anywhere in the world. We have made use of technologies such [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/),[Grafana](http://grafana.org/),[InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) to make the deployment modern, robust, flexible and reproducible.

The Global Hazard Map aims to forecast high-impact weather around the globe over the coming week (seven days). Forecast information for tropical cyclone activity and tracks, precipitation, wind gust, snowfall accumulation as well as severe heat and cold waves are available to view on an interactive map. Additional information related to vulnerability (e.g. Fragile States Index), exposure (e.g. population density) and hazard monitoring (e.g. significant earthquakes) are also provided as optional overlays, to facilitate easier identification of weather events with the potential to cause high-impacts upon society. At the Met Office, one of our primary goals is to provide information so that authorities can mitigate the worst effects of extreme weather. But these situations need to be considered in the context of other hazards - for instance, a storm hitting in the aftermath of an earthquake which requires a different and more coordinated type of response.

With Global Hazard Map, users and collaborative partners can now consider all these hazards simultaneously, and so respond more effectively.
